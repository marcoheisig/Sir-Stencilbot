;;; The PLAYOUT function is tremendously important. It should accurately
;;; reflect the winning probability at each tile in the game. Factors to
;;; consider are:
;;;
;;; - The current number of gold mines.
;;;
;;; - The chances of capturing new gold mines. This is the ability to reach
;;;   gold mines with a health of more than 20.
;;;
;;; - The chances of being slain by an opponent. This is the case when for
;;;   each tavern, there is an enemy closer to this tavern. Note that being
;;;   slain is only as bad as the number of gold mines lost.
;;;
;;; - The chances of slaying an opponent. These chances are computed in a
;;;   similar manner. The chance arises when we are closer to a tavern than
;;;   a (preferably rich) enemy, when all other taverns are blocked by
;;;   other opponents and when we get closer to this enemy.
