;;; The PLAYOUT function is tremendously important. It should accurately
;;; reflect the winning probability at each tile in the game. Factors to
;;; consider are:
;;;
;;; - The current number of gold mines.
;;;
;;; - The chances of capturing new gold mines. This is the ability to reach
;;;   gold mines with a health of more than 20.
;;;
;;; - The chances of being slain by an opponent. This is the case when for
;;;   each tavern, there is an enemy closer to this tavern. And it
;;;   increases drastically when we have less than 21 health left and end
;;;   up next to an opponent. Note that being slain is only as bad as the
;;;   number of gold mines we own. Dying may actually be a smart move.
;;;
;;; - The chances of slaying an opponent. These chances are computed in a
;;;   similar manner. The chance arises when we are closer to a tavern than
;;;   a (preferably rich) enemy and when all other taverns are blocked by
;;;   other opponents.
