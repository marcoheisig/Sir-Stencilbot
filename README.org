#+TITLE: Vindinium

In February 2018, briefly after [[http:www.vindinium.org]] went offline, the
employees of the [[http:www10.cs.fau.de][Chair for System Simulation]] decided to host their own
Vindinium server and have a two day AI battle. Six teams with six different
programming languages (C++, C#, Scala, Python, Common Lisp and Julia)
entered the competition. This repository contains the results of team
Common Lisp.
